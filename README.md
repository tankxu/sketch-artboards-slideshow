# Sketch Artboards Slideshow

Present your idea without slides size limit!

Select artboards and run this plugin, a slideshow website will be generated and opened in the default browser, just like an online presentation.

You can use keyboard to switch the slides, and use mouse to scroll the screen when the slide's size is larger than the browser. So you don't need to scale your long image or big image into a small artboard in your presentation, just show the origin image! 

This plugin will be useful when you want to present your Web Design, UX Flow, Business Analysis and so on.
